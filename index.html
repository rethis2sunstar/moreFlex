        <h4>Jack Astors Habanero Sauce</h4>
        <img src="./assets/pics/image0 (2).jpeg" alt="image of hot sauce bottle - jack astors" />
        <p>This sauce has this nice hint of mango that makes the chicken wings sing.  It adheres well but there is so little of it in the bottle.</p>

              <p>A great chili sauce.  Good for chilli, chicken wings, fajitas and anything else that you want to up the heat.  Use as a condiment or as an ingredient</p>
